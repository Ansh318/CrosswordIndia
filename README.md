## Software Architecture

Data Exploration with Kaggle: We start by exploring and analyzing the dataset sourced from Kaggle, gaining insights into its structure, features, and potential patterns.

🛠️ Model Development with Azure Machine Learning Studio: Using Azure Machine Learning Studio, we design and train our machine learning model. Leveraging the powerful tools and capabilities of Azure ML Studio, we fine-tune our algorithms and optimize model performance.

🚀 Model Deployment on Azure: Once our model is trained and validated, we deploy it as a web service on Azure. This allows us to seamlessly integrate our machine learning solution into a web application environment.

🌐 Web App Development and Hosting on Azure: We develop a web application that interacts with the deployed model, providing a user-friendly interface for making predictions or accessing insights derived from the model's outputs. The web app is hosted on Azure, ensuring scalability, reliability, and high availability.
